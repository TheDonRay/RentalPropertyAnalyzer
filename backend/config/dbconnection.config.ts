  TypeScript doesn't know what's in your .env file at compile time. So it types process.env.ANYTHING as string | undefined to be safe — the variable might simply not exist in the environment. mongoose.connect() only accepts string, so TypeScript forces you to   
  resolve that uncertainty before passing it in.
